### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like the TopOn-iOS-SDK in your projects. You can install it with the following command:

```
$ gem install cocoapods
```

**Podfile**
To integrate AnyThinkiOS SDK into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:

```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'AnyThinkSDKDemo' do
      pod 'AnyThinkiOS','sdk_version'
end
```

#### Subspecs

By default, you get mediation core and all ad network adapters, if you only mediation some ad networks , you need to specify it. 

Podfile example:

```
pod 'AnyThinkiOS/AnyThinkFacebookAdapter'
pod 'AnyThinkiOS/AnyThinkAdmobAdapter'
